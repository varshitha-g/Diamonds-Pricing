## Overview

Diamonds Pricing explores predictive modeling in the field of pricing analytics. By analyzing diamond attributes and their impact on price, this project aims to develop a reliable model for diamond price prediction.

## Dataset

Source: Commonly used diamonds dataset from Kaggle.

Features: Includes attributes like carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and price.

Preprocessing: Data cleaning and normalization were applied to handle missing values and improve model accuracy.
## Data Analysis

Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the relationships between features. Key findings include:

Carat: Strongly correlated with price.

Cut, Color, and Clarity: Moderate impact on price, analyzed through visualizations and statistical analysis.
## Modeling

Several machine learning algorithms were explored for price prediction, including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Hyperparameter tuning was performed to improve model performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting showing the best results.

## Technologies Used

Python: For data processing and modeling.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-Learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

## Results

Model Accuracy: Achieved an R-squared value of approximately 0.95 using Gradient Boosting.

Key Insights: Carat weight and clarity were the strongest predictors of price, while cut had a relatively lower impact.
