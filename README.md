# Diamonds-Pricing

##Predicting the price of diamonds.

##Libraries used: 
Pandas, sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

####In this project I predicted the price of the diamonds based on features like cut,color, clarity, depth etc using the regreesion algorithms. For achieving this I analysed and visualised the relation between this features of diamonds and their price.
