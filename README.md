Diamonds

Given dataset of Diamonds with features such as Cut, Carat, Clarity etc.

I have used Libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn to Analyse and Estimate the Price of Diamonds based on the features.

Used Scikit-Learn to implement Regression models to improve the R2 Score.

Analyzed and Visualized both the distribution of Categorical and Numerical Features.
